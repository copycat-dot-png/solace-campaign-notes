The major creation myth for **Solace** is as below:

In the beginning, before the planet was yet to exist, there was only one higher being - Cthonius, the Life-Father. In this Nothingness he found himself alone, and to stave off this loneliness he forged the planet and breathed Life into it. He called the planet Solas, and he would treat Solas as if she was his own child.

Before long, though for Man this might have been after several eons, Cthonius realized that Solas was lonely. Though she held a great natural bounty, the creatures that ran free along her many vistas were simple. To solve this, Cthonius created the two Goddesses - [[Ashelia, Goddess of Love and Death]] and [[Raya, Goddess of War and Life]]. Deciding that it was time to let his Children be free, he created the two Goddesses with a simple purpose; to advance the Cycles of Life and Death with Solas. To this end, he gave Ashelia the Knowledge of Death, so as to combat the stagnation of Life - and he gave Raya the Knowledge of Life, so as to allow for Creation. 

From these Gifts did come Mankind, the Children of Raya. Mankind was smart, and strong, and could flourish and develop without Divine Intervention. Mankind lived long and prosperous lives, but their hunger for ever-greater heights set them against Raya, as they wished to know how to Create with their own hands. 

Raya was purged in Mankind's Fires, and for her Sacrifice she was granted Cthonius' final breaths. Eternal Life would be hers, in the form of Reincarnation, before Cthonius soon returned to the Void that had spawned him, leaving his Children with one last message.

"My Beloved Children, treat this planet with love and with care. Do not judge your creations so - they are young, and foolish, and need guidance. Teach them Solace, and show them Peace."

It is Thus that our Great Planet received its name.

*The creation myth can be often found in ancient Varani texts, though the Church of the Twin Suns oft rejects these myths, due to their own personal beliefs. Few know these texts anymore, and the myth is often considered to be lost to time.*
