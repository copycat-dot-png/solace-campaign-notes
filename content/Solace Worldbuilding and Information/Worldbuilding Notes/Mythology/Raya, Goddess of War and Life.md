**Chaotic Good**
Raya is represented as a womanly figure clad in all black, with a veil over her face obscuring any from seeing her true visage. She carried a sword with her at all times, and the ground she walks on is often covered in shadow. Despite this, it is believed that Raya herself **does not** cast her own shadow.

Raya is the Goddess of War and Life, a physical representation of the Cycle of Rebirth that all go through, including herself. This is also a representation of how transformative War is, and how it leads to new Life. War changes countries, people, the world. Life, too, is ever-changing and ever-evolving. Every second in one's life, the world around them is changing in a great many ways. This is what Raya's Cycle represents.

Unlike her counterpart, Ashelia, Raya is not immortal. She lives among people, breathes and eats and sleeps like any normal mortal. She breaks bread and makes friends with her subjects, though many would not be able to tell it is the Goddess herself unless she chooses to reveal to them.

The Cycle always ensures that her path crosses with Ashelia's in each life she lives, unknowing of her status as Goddess until she meets her lover once more. In every lifetime, the two are always fated to fall in love with each other, but Ashelia can never interfere until Raya finds her herself. 

Ashelia always teaches Raya about the world, and Raya will always listen - curious, excited to learn, and willing to help make change. It is often said that times of great change in the world are caused by Raya's 'awakening' and exercising of her newfound and newly realized potential. 

Raya's symbols are that of crosses, swords, and flowers.

Raya represents the clerical domains of Life, War, and Nature.
